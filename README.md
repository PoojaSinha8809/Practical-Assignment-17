# Practical-Assignment-17

## Project Name - "Comparing Classifiers"

**Objective:**

This is third practical application assignment, the goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) encountered in the program. We will use a dataset related to the marketing of bank products over the telephone.

**Source Dataset and Insights on data**

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing) . It originates from a Portuguese banking institution and comprises data collected from multiple marketing campaigns aimed at promoting term deposit subscriptions. The dataset includes various client and campaign-related attributes, making it well-suited for classification and predictive modeling tasks. For more information, we have used the article accompaying the dataset [here](https://github.com/PoojaSinha8809/Practical-Assignment-17/blob/main/CRISP-DM-BANK.pdf)

In the project, we have used the dataset located here - "data/bank-additional/bank-additional-full.csv". This bank-additional-full.csv contains all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analyzed. 

With reference to paper study, we are going to use CRISP-DM methodology. This dataset contains real-world data collected from a series of marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution, specifically aimed at promoting term deposit subscriptions. The primary business objective is to develop a model that can predict the success of a contact â€” that is, whether a client will subscribe to a deposit. Such a model can significantly enhance campaign efficiency by identifying the key factors influencing customer decisions. This, in turn, supports better allocation of resources, such as time, personnel, and communication efforts, and enables the selection of a more targeted and cost-effective group of potential customers.

The techiqiue we used in reference to the paper follows as mentioned below:
